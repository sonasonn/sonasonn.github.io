        <p>Personal Website Project: Due February 20, 2015 17:00
Requirements:
1. Make a website with at least 4 pages. I recommend 'home', 'about', 'projects', and 'contact', but you can make them whatever you want.
2. Your website should be written in HTML and CSS, and then posted to GitHub Pages.
3. You'll need to setup a GitHub Pages repository named (yourname.github.io). Instructions are available at <a href="https://pages.github.com/">https://pages.github.com/</a> 
4. Write your website in Atom or NotePad++, which is an IDE - a program designed for writing code. <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.7.4.html">http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.7.4.html</a> 
5. Your website should have at least 5 pictures in total (that you have permission to use), at least some CSS, and some HTML. A picture can simply be a screenshot of a project you worked on, or something similar.
6. When you turn in your website, you'll need to run it through the validator first <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a> and provide a screenshot - we'll talk about this before the due date. It doesn't have to pass validation, but it's a good way to find major issues before you launch a website.
7. When you turn in your website, you'll need to have answered the question checklist (in a Word doc) for your website. I highly recommend doing this first. <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/01/question-checklist-for-reviewing-your-new-marketing-materials.html">http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/01/question-checklist-for-reviewing-your-new-marketing-materials.html</a> </p>

<p>Examples of work:
<a href="http://nickd.org/">http://nickd.org/</a> would earn about a 6 or 7 – no pictures, no visible CSS, no menu structure
<a href="http://old.mikeshenry.com/">http://old.mikeshenry.com/</a> is closer to a 9 or 10 for this project – still missing pictures, some design issues. 
Note: I know we’ve just started on this, so it’s not going to look as put together as the examples in <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3845-effort-in-the-application-sites-that-got-our-attention-and-got-basecampers-their-jobs">https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3845-effort-in-the-application-sites-that-got-our-attention-and-got-basecampers-their-jobs</a>, but they should provide some inspiration and direction as you get started.</p>

<p>Grading rubric: 10% of your final grade
5% for completing a website and having at least 4 pages, some HTML and CSS, and at least 5 pictures.
2% for running it through the validator and writing clean, readable code (indented, spaced out)
2% for thoroughly completing the question checklist and turning it in
1% for the information architecture and user interface design (does it look like you built something based on the question checklist’s answers)</p>
